                <p>The Senegal national football team (French: Équipe de football du Senegal), nicknamed Les Lions de la Teranga (meaning: The Lions of Teranga), represents Senegal in international association football and is operated by the Senegalese Football Federation. They are the current champions of both the Africa Cup of Nations and African Nations Championship. </p>

                <h2>Brief History</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Senegal gained its independence from France on 4 April 1960, and the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) was founded that year. The first Senegal match took place on 31 December 1961 against Dahomey (now Benin), a 3–2 loss. The FSF has been affiliated with FIFA since 1962 and has been a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) since 1963. Senegal's first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations was in 1965, where they finished second in their group, and lost 1–0 to Ivory Coast to finish in fourth place. After a group stage exit at the AFCON three years later, they would not qualify for the tournament until 1986. </p>
                <p>In the 1990 Africa Cup of Nations, Senegal finished fourth; they hosted the 1992 tournament, where after finishing second in their group, they were eliminated by Cameroon in the quarterfinals. Senegal lost the 2002 final on a penalty shoot-out after drawing 0–0 with Cameroon.[4] Later that year, Senegal made their debut appearance at the World Cup. After defeating defending world champions France in their opening game, they drew with Denmark and Uruguay to progress from the group stage, then beat Sweden in extra time in the round of 16 to reach the quarter-finals, one of only four African teams to do so (alongside Cameroon in 1990, Ghana in 2010 and Morocco in 2022). There, they lost to Turkey in extra time.[5][6]</p>

                <h2>Competitive record</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>In the 2000s, Senegal began to surge and became a more competitive opponent in the Africa Cup of Nations. Following a successful FIFA World Cup debut in 2002, in which the side reached the quarter-finals, Senegal established itself as a new powerhouse in Africa. The 2002 Africa Cup of Nations tournament marked a defeat to Cameroon 2–3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the final.[33] Senegal once again finished as runners-up in 2019, losing the final 0–1 to Algeria,[34] and finally won their first AFCON title in 2021. </p>
